Python to convert MARC/XML Bibliographic records to BIBFRAME resources.

The script outputs four JSON files.  The JSON is designed to be used
with Simile Exhibit.   The script can be run simply as:

	python readmarcxml.py /path/to/marc/xml/file
	
The output files will be saved in html/data/ as file names beginning with the 
word "default."  You may also specify a base file name, but the resulting 
files will still be saved to html/data.
